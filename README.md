# SPI-master-for-MCP3202-ADC

This is a custom serial peripheral interface for a 12 bit ADC (MCP3202)
  Datasheet for ADC is here: http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/21034d.pdf
  
  also here is the EDAplayground link for version 1.0 (I think the sample frequency is around 39 KHz):

Please watch my youtube video on version 1 for more clarification: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upVfMuauNak&t=406s

In Version 2.0 I updated the sampling frequency to its max 50 KHz (in reality 49.84 KHz), and changed some timing
on the data valid signal, as well as some of the parameters. 

:) happy interfacing!
